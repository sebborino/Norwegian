# Your passenger rights

When things don’t go to plan, we’ll help you in line with EU regulation 261/2004 – a
set of common rules all European airlines follow.

## Delayed flight  

You&#39;re entitled to the rights listed under ‘Right to care’, if you&#39;re delayed by 2 hours or
more for flights of 1500 km or less; or 3 hours or more for flights within Europe of
more than 1500 km and all other flights between 1500 and 3500 km; or 4 hours or
more for flights of 3500 km or more. Depending on the length of the delay you may
be entitled to the rights listed under &#39;Right to rebooking or refund&#39; and &#39;Right to
compensation&#39;.

## Cancelled flight

If your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to the rights listed under ‘What you’re
entitled to’. You are not entitled to compensation if:

- you’re informed of the cancellation at least 2 weeks before the scheduled departure
time; or

- you’re informed of the cancellation between 2 weeks and 7days before the
scheduled departure time and you’re offered a rebooking, allowing you to depart no
more than 2hours before the scheduled departure time and reach your final
destination less than 4 hours after the scheduled arrival time; or

- you’re informed of the cancellation less than 7 days before the scheduled departure
time and are you’re offered are booking, allowing you to depart no more than one
hour before the scheduled departure time and to reach your final destination less
than 2 hours after the scheduled arrival time.

## Denied boarding

If you volunteer to give up your seat when a flight is overbooked, you’re entitled to
the rights listed under ‘Right to rebooking and refund’, in addition to compensation to
be agreed upon between you and Norwegian.
If we don’t have enough volunteers, and you’re involuntarily denied boarding, you’ll
be entitled to the rights set out under ‘What you’re entitled to’.

## What you’re entitled to Right to care

If you’re involuntarily denied boarding, or your flight is cancelled or significantly
delayed (as outlined above), you’ll be entitled to:

- **a)** meals and refreshments vouchers in reasonable relation to the waiting time,
provided it won’t further delay departure of the flight,
- **b)** two telephone calls, telex or fax messages or e-mails,
- **c)** accommodation and transport between the airport and place of accommodation (if
you’re offered a flight the next day).

## Your passenger rights Right to rebooking or refund

If you’re denied boarding, your flight is cancelled or delayed by 5 hours or more, we
will take all reasonable measures to provide you with an alternative flight to your final
destination at no extra cost. You’re also permitted to change the date of travel to a
later date to your final destination, provided there are seats available. If you no
longer wish to travel, you’re entitled to a full refund of the unused ticket, and any
onward flights with Norwegian, including your return ticket.

## Right to compensation

Compensation will not be payable if the cause for the delay or cancellation is due to
extraordinary circumstances, which could not have been avoided even if all
reasonable measures had been taken. This may include, but may not be limited to,
weather conditions affecting both the scheduled flight and earlier departures, strike
action and other work conflict, air traffic control, unexpected illness of airline crew
and other unforeseen circumstances that represent a safety hazard beyond our
control. If you’re involuntarily denied boarding, or your flight is cancelled or delayed
by 3 hours or more on arrival due to reasons within our control, you&#39;ll be entitled to
the following compensation:

- €250 for flights of 1500 km or less; or

- €400 for flights within Europe of more than 1500 km, and for all other flights
between 1500 and 3,500 km; or

- €600 for flights of 3500 km or more.

The compensation set out above will be reduced by 50% if we’re able to offer you
rebooking on an alternative flight and the arrival time of that flight does not exceed
the scheduled arrival time of the flight booked:

- by 2 hours for flights of 1500 km or less; or
- by 3 hours for flights within Europe of more than 1500 km, and for all other flights
between 1500 and 3500 km; or

- by 4 hours for flights of 3500 km or more.
