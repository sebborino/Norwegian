If you&#39;re travelling with a larger instrument, such as a violin or viola, then you can bring this instead of a carry-on bag. The instrument can be slightly bigger than a regular carry on bag, but must not exceed 90 x 35 x 20 cm and the carry-on weight limit for your fare type. We will make every effort to accommodate your instrument in the cabin, but we do recommend you arrive at the gate early for boarding to ensure there&#39;s space in the overhead compartments. If there isn&#39;t adequate room, your instrument may have to be checked into the cargo hold.</p><p>Please check <a href="./handbaggage.html">our hand baggage rules</a> for more information.</p>',7)]))}const d=a(i,[["render",s]]);export{g as __pageData,d as default};
