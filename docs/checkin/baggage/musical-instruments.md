# Musical instruments

Touring with your tuba? Depending on its size, your instrument can be transported in the cabin or cargo hold. Remember to travel smart â€“ use a hard case and take out travel insurance when flying with fragile items.

## Instruments in the cabin

We understand that sometimes you'll want to bring your instrument with you on board.

## Take your instrument as hand baggage

You can bring a small musical instrument on board provided you do not exceed the hand baggage allowance for your fare type. If you're travelling with a larger instrument, such as a violin or viola, then you can bring this instead of a carry-on bag. The instrument can be slightly bigger than a regular carry on bag, but must not exceed 90 x 35 x 20 cm and the carry-on weight limit for your fare type. We will make every effort to accommodate your instrument in the cabin, but we do recommend you arrive at the gate early for boarding to ensure there's space in the overhead compartments. If there isn't adequate room, your instrument may have to be checked into the cargo hold.
