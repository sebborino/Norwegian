## Checked baggage

Choose the fare type that suits you best, and only pay for the baggage you actually need.

# Your checked baggage allowance

Your ticket type determines if checked baggage is included, or whether you'll need to pay a little extra. Special baggage (ski equipment, golf bags etc.) cannot be ordered as checked baggage.

You can add checked baggage to an existing booking up until 4 hours before departure. It's quick and easy to do this online or by giving our Contact Centre a ring.
