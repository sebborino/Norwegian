## Checkin Hand baggage

Everyone can bring one underseat bag to be stored under the seat in front. 
If you’re travelling on a LowFare+ or Flex ticket, you can also bring one overhead cabin bag.

# Your ticket type determines your allowance.

Be sure to measure your bags and remember that it’s the combined weight of your hand baggage that counts!
