# Airport check-in
Quick and straightforward, because checking in should never hold anybody up.

## Use our fast check-in kiosks

You can check in using our self-service kiosks at selected airports. All you need to do is enter your booking reference and print your boarding pass – easy as that!

- If you're travelling with checked baggage, deliver it to the bag drop area (with bag tags attached) after you've checked in.
    
- If you’re travelling with a car seat or stroller for your child or infant, visit our check-in counter for assistance once you’ve checked in.

- If you’d like any extra assistance, or you were unable to check in at the kiosk, please visit our check-in count

## When to use our check-in counter

You must check in at our check-in counter **at least one hour before departure** if you:

- Need special assistance
- Are using our Unaccompanied Minor Service 
- Are travelling with pets, musical instruments or weapons.

This gives us the time to take care of any travel details and give you the best possible service.

## Boarding passes issued by travel agencies
Boarding passes issued by a travel agency lack information you need for boarding process. If you wish to use a digital boarding pass, please use our Travel Assistant app.
